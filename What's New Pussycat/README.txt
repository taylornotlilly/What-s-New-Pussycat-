"We walk into the Salt and Pepper Diner one day, and they had a jukebox there, 
alright? And the jukebox was 3 plays for $1. So we put in $7 and selected 21
plays of Tom Jones' "What's New Pussycat?" And then we ordered and waited."

"Here's the thing about when "What's New Pussycat?" plays over and over and over and
over again. The second time it plays, you're immediate though isn't, "Hey someone's
playing "What's New Pussycat?" again," it's "Hey.."What's New Pussycat?" is a lot
longer than I first thought." The third time it plays, you're thinking, "Maybe
someone's playing "What's New Pussycat?" again." The FOURTH time it plays, you're
thinking, "WOAH. Someone just played "What's New Pussycat?" FOUR times, or at least
someone played it twice, and it's a really long song."

"But a word about my friend John and what a genius he was because when were were first
up at the jukebox and we were punching in the "What's New Pussycats?" I punched in about
7, and then John says to me, "Hey, hey, hey wait..before we drop in another "What's 
New Pussycat?", let's put in 1 "It's Not Unusual"."

"And that was when the afternoon went fron GOOD to GREAT!"


The Salt and Pepper Diner is being attacked by a fleet of "What's New
Pussycat?" and a single "It's Not Unusual". Play as Jukebox and destroy all 21 
songs before everyone in the diner loses their marbles over the shenanigans of 
two 11 year old boys named John.
